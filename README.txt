 Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project builds a classification model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning (Random Forest).

 Project Objective
- Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a Random Forest classifier.
- Handle class imbalance using SMOTE.
- Evaluate using confusion matrix, ROC AUC, precision-recall.

 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Features include transaction time, amount, anonymized PCA features.
